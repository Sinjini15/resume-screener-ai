# Resume Screener AI ðŸš€

An AI-powered system to automatically screen, rank, and retrieve resumes based on job descriptions, powered by machine learning and modern retrieval architectures.

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

This project builds a full resume screening pipeline:

- **Resume Parsing**: Structured synthetic resume data creation.
- **Job Matching**: Matching resumes to multiple job descriptions using skills, experience, and education alignment.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of nuanced raw signals (skills match %, experience matching, education evaluation).
- **Model Training**: CatBoost Regressor trained on engineered features to predict match quality.
- **Retrieval System** (Upcoming): Fast API service to retrieve top candidates for a given job query.

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance

- Model: **CatBoost Regressor**
- Final Test RMSE: **0.00004**
- Interpretation:  
  The model achieves near-perfect prediction of resume-to-job match scores, demonstrating high signal extraction and strong feature engineering alignment with the target metric.

## Running Locally (Without Docker)

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Sinjini15/resume-screener-ai.git
cd resume-screener-ai
```
2. Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the FastAPI server:

```
uvicorn src.api_service:app --reload
```

4. Open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

## Running with Docker

1. Build the Docker image:

```
docker build -t resume-screener-api .
```

2. Run the Docker container:

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 resume-screener-api
```

3. Open your broswer at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

## Running with Docker Compose:

1. Use Docker Compose to build and run:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

2. To stop the conmtainer:
```
docker-compose down
```

## API Endpoint

* POST/retrieve
Retrieve ranked resumes based on the given job description


âœ… Fully modularized, production-ready codebase with clean separation of concerns.
