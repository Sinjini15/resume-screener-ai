# Resume Screener AI ðŸš€

An AI-powered system to automatically screen, rank, and retrieve resumes based on job descriptions, powered by machine learning and modern retrieval architectures.

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

This project builds a full resume screening pipeline:

- **Resume Parsing**: Structured synthetic resume data creation.
- **Job Matching**: Matching resumes to multiple job descriptions using skills, experience, and education alignment.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of nuanced raw signals (skills match %, experience matching, education evaluation).
- **Model Training**: CatBoost Regressor trained on engineered features to predict match quality.
- **Retrieval System** (Upcoming): Fast API service to retrieve top candidates for a given job query.

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance

- Model: **CatBoost Regressor**
- Final Test RMSE: **0.00004**
- Interpretation:  
  The model achieves near-perfect prediction of resume-to-job match scores, demonstrating high signal extraction and strong feature engineering alignment with the target metric.
